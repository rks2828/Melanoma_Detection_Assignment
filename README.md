# Melanoma Detection Assignment
> Multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- The project is a CNN Based Model which is trained using ISIC Images to predict skin cancer using the trained model over the dataset images.
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)


## Conclusions
- CNN Model was built using the ISIC dataset containing 9 classes of skin cancer images. These images were used to train the CNN Model.
- Training - train accuracy = 90%, validation accuracy = 80%



## Technologies Used
- tensorflow
- numpy, pandas, matplotlib
- Augmentor

## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by a problem assignment given by Upgrad
